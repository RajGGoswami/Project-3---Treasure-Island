# Project-3---Treasure-Island

This is a beginner Python project built as part of my 100 Days of Code challenge.

It is a text-based adventure game that introduces decision-making, branching logic, and basic game flow using Python.

**Project Overview**

Treasure Island is a command-line game where the player makes a series of choices to find hidden treasure.

Each choice affects the outcome of the game, leading either to success or a “Game Over”.

**Why this project exists**

This project marks a key milestone in my learning journey where I moved from:

Simple input/output programs
to

Programs with logic, branching, and multiple outcomes

It helped me understand how real programs respond differently based on user decisions.

**What I learned**

How to use if, elif, and else statements

How to nest conditionals to form a decision tree

How to normalize user input using .lower()

How to display multi-line ASCII art using triple-quoted strings

How program flow changes based on user choices

**How the game works (step-by-step)**

The game starts by displaying ASCII art and a welcome message.

The player chooses a direction at a crossroads.

Depending on the choice, the player:

Proceeds further into the game, or

Immediately reaches a “Game Over”.

Additional decisions determine whether the player wins or loses.

The game ends after a final outcome is printed.
